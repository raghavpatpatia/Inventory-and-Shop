# Unity Inventory and Shop System

Welcome to the Unity Inventory and Shop System project! This project provides a foundation for creating an inventory and shop functionality in Unity, featuring a modular and organized code structure. The codebase utilizes design patterns such as Dependency Injection, MVC (Model-View-Controller), and Observer.

## Overview

This Unity project focuses on implementing a flexible and extensible inventory and shop system. It includes a UI manager, inventory management, shop functionality, money management, and more. The codebase is designed to be modular, making it easy to understand, extend, and customize for games requiring inventory and shop features.

## Features

- **UI Manager**: Manages the game's user interface, including main menu buttons, inventory display, shop interface, and more.
- **Inventory System**: Allows players to gather items, view their inventory, and interact with items.
- **Shop Functionality**: Provides a shop where players can buy and sell items.
- **Money Management**: Tracks the player's in-game currency.
- **Message Box**: Displays messages to the player, such as notifications or alerts.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilizes Dependency Injection, MVC, and Observer patterns for a scalable and maintainable codebase.

## Code Structure

The codebase follows a modular structure with an emphasis on the following design patterns:

- **Dependency Injection**: Components are loosely coupled through dependency injection for better testability and flexibility.
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Separation of concerns to enhance code organization. Controllers handle game logic, views manage UI elements, and models represent the data.
- **Observer Pattern**: Used for event handling, allowing different components to communicate without direct dependencies.

## Dependencies

This project has no external dependencies beyond the Unity game engine.
